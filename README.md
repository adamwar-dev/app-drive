### Backend

To run the server application, you need to have ISS (Internet Information Services) and the .NET 6 framework installed on your machine.\
We recommend installing Visual Studio and running the project directly from it.

To visit the swagger, navigate to [http://localhost:4000/swagger/index.html](http://localhost:4000/swagger/index.html).

### Database

To run SQL Express use command line or (recommend) SSMS.

You can set up a trusted connection locally in the configuration of the server application, however, in Docker, it is necessary to create a user with appropriate permissions.
